# LaunchPass
LaunchPass is a highly customizable frontend for most Emulators on Xbox, it started off as a fork of [RetroPass](https://github.com/retropassdev/RetroPass), as time goes on LaunchPass continues to get more Features and is heading in a different direction to RetroPass in terms of Development.

## Usage
[Check out our Wiki for setup and usage intructions](https://github.com/Misunderstood-Wookiee/LaunchPass/wiki)


## Limitations
 - 2000 Total Titles Displayed in any given playlist/platform, 1000 optimal.
 - Xbox Only
 - Optimized for Gamepad Only
 - Zipped content supported only if RetroArch, Retrix Gold or other supported cores/emulators support compressed archive format.
 - No Automatic Scrapper, you must use [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com). for Setup (More Info Below)
 - EmulationStation support is discontinued sorry!
 - No Duckstation as UWP support got dropped by the original developer and we no plans to add it unless a new port is made.
 - Video Background can cause lag in some-instances due to UWP limitations, we recommend 1080p resolutions and use a Image for the Game Details to reduce how many video play at the same time. (Series X may fair better in this regard)
